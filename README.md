# RicoBot

This is my first Discord bot and my first time using GitHub!
RicoBot is a bot for my server with my friends.
His main function is to let us change each other's nicknames.
In order to do that, his role must be moved above all other roles.
He cannot change the server owner's nickname, but will instead tag them
and ask them to do so.
